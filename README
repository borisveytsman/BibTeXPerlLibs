			   BibTeX Perl Libs
			     Version 1.8
		  Gerhard Gossen, Boris Veytsman, Karl Berry

This package provides BibTeX-related Perl libraries by Gerhard Gossen,
maintained and repackaged by Boris Veytsman for TeX Live and other
TDS-compliant distributions.  The libraries are written in pure Perl,
so shoud work out of the box on any architecture.

To use them in your scripts, add to the @INC variable the directory
scripts/bibtexperllibs inside your TeX distribution. A script ltx2unitxt
packages the conversion libraries for use from the command line.
